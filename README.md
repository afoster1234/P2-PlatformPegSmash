## Project Report

Project 2 was actually some of the most fun I have had coding in a while! I loved the creative freedom of the game development process as I have learned from the past project as well, the sky is the limit. Despite having a few mistakes here and there in the last 3 iterations of Project 1, I think this time around and starting fresh, I had a much better idea of how things in this engine work and the different types of nodes there are and how they work, sometimes working together. I really hope that I got all of the A tier requirements fufilled because I combed over the project and the checklist several times before deciding that I had submittable content. One of the things I liked about the porject on this go around is that I actually had quite a bit of trouble with the AnimationPlayer and getting the player to be correctly oriented. I know it sounds weird to say I liked struggling, yet that is the essence of learning something new. In my opinion it is also especially prevelant in writing code because once you have invested enough time into it and figure out what works and what does not, that is when you really gain a broader view of how things work and ultimately become a better creator.

- [X] C-6: The game includes a player-controlled character, implemented as a <code>KinematicBody</code> and positioned in a conventional, <code>TileMap</code>-based, 2D-platforming world.
- [X] C-7: The player's character can move left and right, with its movement bounded by impassable tiles.
- [X] C-8: The player's character can jump up and onto tiles.
- [X] C-9: The player's character falls down when walking off a ledge.
- [X] B-1: The <code>README.md</code> file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.
- [X] B-2: The playable game is published to GitHub Pages and linked from the <code>README.md</code> file.
- [X] B-3: The source code and project structure comply with our adopted style guides.
- [X] B-4: There is a sprite element in the level that the player can interact with, such as a collectible, an enemy, a book, or a switch.
- [X] B-5: The camera follows the character through a world that is larger than one screen.
- [X] A-1: Earn one star
- [X] ⭐ Animate the main character using either <code>AnimatedSprite</code> or cutout animation
- [ ] ⭐ Include parallax scrolling in the background.
